<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Edwin and I'm 28 years old. I'm an business man who run agency for digital marketing such as Tiktok, Instagram,etc.
   I really like creating creative contents for myself and also my clients. Currently I'm planning for my personal branding and I'm really 
  looking forward to this project.</p>

<p>While focusing on digital marketing company, I started to develop my skill at coding. Even though it is really hard but I will make sure 
  I can do it and proove to myself that I can do anything that I want if I  focus on that. Learning how to create and develop websites also 
  part of my plan to expand my business scope. In this way I can help my clients if they need a website developer. Otherwise, it will also 
  give me more value so I can collaborate with many company in the future.
</p>

<p>Hopefully I can learn everything about programming skills and one day become a professional in this job as well. I will work really hard 
  to improve my skill no matter what it takes. God bless us!
